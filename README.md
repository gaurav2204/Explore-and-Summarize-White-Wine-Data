# Explore-and-Summarize-White-Wine-Data

For this project, we will conduct our own exploratory data analysis and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a whitewine dataset.
The analysis should be almost like a stream-of-consciousness as we ask questions, create visualizations, and explore your data.
This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer. As John Tukey stated, "The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data." We answer interesting questions about data and give you a chance to explore. We will provide some options of data sets to explore; however, we may choose to explore an entirely different data set.
