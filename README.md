# Explore-and-Summarize-White-Wine-Data
After Plotting &amp; Analysing(univariatet,Bivariate &amp; Multivariate) white wine dataset we come up the following conclusion:&lt;br/> `01.` We analysis how alcohol,desity and residual sugar have strongest correlationship.&lt;br/> `02.` The correlation between volatile acidity,pH &amp; quality of wine with Alcohol surprise us.&lt;br/> `03.`Quality of wine divides into three category low,medium,and high and rating divides on 3 to 9.we analysis that quality 5 and 6 have medium quality have higher number of entry in dataset or we can say that quality of wine depends on taste of consumer but better wine rating is lies between 8~9.&lt;br/>  `04.`Total and free sulfur dioxide shows correlation with sulphates and also together.  &lt;br/> `05.`Alcohol level of wine decreases with the growth of residual sugar level.alcohol also plays key role to that investigation as we already observed with our scatter plots.  &lt;br/> `06.`White wine data have no missing value and different types of variables to explorer.&lt;br/> `07.`All plotted box plot have mostly normal distributed and most of scatterplot show exact relationship according to analysis.  &lt;br/>  we found a little struggle to analysis the outliners cause they have many of them but we do and overcome on it. For further investigation we will need more data and we do some statistical analysis and multiple variables explorer by deep analysis of alcohol and quality of wine.as we categorise the alcohol percentage than we do some extra analysis.
